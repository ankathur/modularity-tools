 MODULARITY TOOLS 
------------------

Modularity tools is a parent workspace for all projects, scripts and tools developed as part of modularity effort in glassfish.

The tools provided here includes scripts for measuring metrics related to startup time, memory consumption and states of OSGI bundles.

Also there is a package-analyser tool for analysing dependencies between OSGI bundles and a visulaization tool for drawing a directed graph for the same.

In future more tools will be added to this space which will aid in modularity analysis of GlassFish Project.
